## Thoughts on this project
I got stuck on this project due to the icons and color scheme selection. What happened was that I didn't know how to work with svgs (or that they exist, for that matter). Using images as icons hampered my progress because I haven't decided the color scheme for the project yet. I could have used the original template provided by Odin but I didn't want to :)

Only after I started using svgs for icons did my progress restart, so I lost around 2 weeks due to procrastination.
I regret that now.

Anyway, this was a fun project all in all but much more complicated than the flexbox one. Looking forward to using both techniques next time.
